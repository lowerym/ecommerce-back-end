# E-Commerce Back-End

## Description
For this project, I had to build out the back end of an e-commerce platform. The starter code was already provided to me, so I had to build out the model and route files. Utilizing the command-line interface, or CLI, and object-relational mapping, I built a system where users can get products, categories, and tags, either just one or all together. They can also add new entries, update existing ones, or delete any they see fit.
